/**
 * This plugins supports the JANI high-level model description.
 * JANI stands for JSON Automata Network Interchange format.
 * This specification is intended to be used as
 * <ul>
 * <li>an exchange format between EPMC and tool chains developed by
 * Arnd Hartmanns and others,</li>
 * <li>potentially used internally in EPMC by transforming other high-level
 * model descriptions to this format to ease supporting them,</li>
 * <li>a specification mechanism for which we can support a graphical model
 * editor.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A specification of the format (work in progress) can be found at
 * <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BDQIzPBtscxJFFlDUEPIo8ivKHgXT8_X6hz5quq7jK0/">
